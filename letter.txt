Hello,

My name is Alan, and I just came across the listing for the room you have available. I am extremely interested in this opportunity.

I have recently been accepted into the first year of university and I am excited to embark on my educational journey. While I don't have any proficiency in the German language yet, I am absolutely willing and determined to put in the effort to learn it as quickly as possible. I am a sociable individual and I'm eager to become a part of the engaging community you've established.

The description of the room has captured my attention. It would be wonderful to live in a furnished room with amenities such as Internet access and included electricity expenses. Furthermore, your description of the community resonates with me. I believe in the power of interaction and collaborative activities, and I would be thrilled to join such a diverse and friendly community. Your shared activities, travels, and events sound truly exciting.

In terms of my academic plans, I will be focusing on studying [Your Field of Study] at [Name of Your University]. I believe that this opportunity for communal living and learning could greatly contribute to my growth as a student and an individual.

I would like to send you a more detailed letter about why I believe I would be a suitable candidate for your community. I will also provide you with my email address for correspondence. I am ready to start a new chapter in Berlin and become a part of your unique community.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
